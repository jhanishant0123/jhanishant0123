🎯 **About Me**

I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, with a deep-rooted passion for **VLSI design**, **Computer Architecture**, and **Digital Electronics**.  
I thrive on building efficient hardware blocks using **Verilog**, and love transforming logic into real, working silicon via tools like **Vivado** and **Cadence Virtuoso**.

🚀 **Currently**, I’m exploring:
- Advanced RTL design methodologies
- ASIC backend flow and Static Timing Analysis
- Digital memory design with SRAM, FIFO, and RAM modules
- Open-source RISC-V architecture
